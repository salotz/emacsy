* Emacsy dev guide
my little experiments:
- dna: items (avoiding using the word "object" for clarity) contain
  information (really, procedures) to manipulate themselves.
- imperative style is hard to comprehend, make everything functional
  (and "nicer") as much as possible.
- Reduce overall code.
- woohoo! mixing of types is solved by throwing errors instead! Instead
  of a quiet crash, now you can atleast debug it.

A sensible advice: (don't change anything, just fix the bugs.)
- goops are useful
- better error reporting, avoid errors originating from a lower
  function, example:
> (define mul *)
> (mul 2 "h") -> ERROR: In procedure *: In procedure *: Wrong type: "h"
> (define (mul . rest)
    (if (number? (car rest))
        (* (car rest) (mul (cdr rest)))
        (error "In proc mul: please provide valid numbers")))
> (mul 2 "h") -> ERROR: In procedure scm-error: In proc mul: please provide valid numbers
